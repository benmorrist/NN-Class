        "\n",
        "1. *Crop full width or height*: This is in `item_tfms`, so it's applied to each individual image before it is copied to the GPU. It's used to ensure all images are the same size. On the training set, the crop area is chosen randomly. On the validation set, the center square of the image is always chosen.\n",
        "2. *Random crop and augment*: This is in `batch_tfms`, so it's applied to a batch all at once on the GPU, which means it's fast. On the validation set, only the resize to the final size needed for the model is done here. On the training set, the random crop and any other augmentations are done first.\n",
        "\n",
        "To implement this process in fastai you use `Resize` as an item transform with a large size, and `RandomResizedCrop` as a batch transform with a smaller size. `RandomResizedCrop` will be added for you if you include the `min_scale` parameter in your `aug_transforms` function, as was done in the `DataBlock` call in the previous section. Alternatively, you can use `pad` or `squish` instead of `crop` (the default) for the initial `Resize`.\n",

We use that for one mini-batch, find what the losses are afterwards, and then increase the learning rate by some percentage (e.g., doubling it each time). Then we do another mini-batch, track the loss, and double the learning rate again. We keep doing this until the loss gets worse, instead of better.

        "Often you will find that you are limited by time, rather than generalization and accuracy, when choosing how many epochs to train for. So your first approach to training should be to simply pick a number of epochs that will train in the amount of time that you are happy to wait for. Then look at the training and validation loss plots, as shown above, and in particular your metrics, and if you see that they are still getting better even in your final epochs, then you know that you have not trained for too long.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, you may well see that the metrics you have chosen are really getting worse at the end of training. Remember, it's not just that we're looking for the validation loss to get worse, but the actual metrics. Your validation loss will first get worse during training because the model gets overconfident, and only later will get worse because it is incorrectly memorizing the data. We only care in practice about the latter issue. Remember, our loss function is just something that we use to allow our optimizer to have something it can differentiate and optimize; it's not actually the thing we care about in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before the days of 1cycle training it was very common to save the model at the end of each epoch, and then select whichever model had the best accuracy out of all of the models saved in each epoch. This is known as *early stopping*. However, this is very unlikely to give you the best answer, because those epochs in the middle occur before the learning rate has had a chance to reach the small values, where it can really find the best result. Therefore, if you find that you have overfit, what you should actually do is retrain your model from scratch, and this time select a total number of epochs based on where your previous best results were found.\n",

        "If you have the time to train for more epochs, you may want to instead use that time to train more parameters—that is, use a deeper architecture."

        "In general, a model with more parameters can model your data more accurately. (There are lots and lots of caveats to this generalization, and it depends on the specifics of the architectures you are using, but it is a reasonable rule of thumb for now.) For most of the architectures that we will be seeing in this book, you can create larger versions of them by simply adding more layers. However, since we want to use pretrained models, we need to make sure that we choose a number of layers that have already been pretrained for us.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is why, in practice, architectures tend to come in a small number of variants. For instance, the ResNet architecture that we are using in this chapter comes in variants with 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layer, pretrained on ImageNet. A larger (more layers and parameters; sometimes described as the \"capacity\" of a model) version of a ResNet will always be able to give us a better training loss, but it can suffer more from overfitting, because it has more parameters to overfit with.\n",

        "\n",
        "The other downside of deeper architectures is that they take quite a bit longer to train. One technique that can speed things up a lot is *mixed-precision training*. This refers to using less-precise numbers (*half-precision floating point*, also called *fp16*) where possible during training. As we are writing these words in early 2020, nearly all current NVIDIA GPUs support a special feature called *tensor cores* that can dramatically speed up neural network training, by 2-3x. They also require a lot less GPU memory. To enable this feature in fastai, just add `to_fp16()` after your `Learner` creation (you also need to import the module).\n",

You aren't likely to need to actually implement cross-entropy loss from scratch yourself in practice, but it's really important you understand the inputs to and output from that function, because it (or a variant of it, as we'll see in the next chapter) is used in nearly every classification model. So when you want to debug a model, or put a model in production, or improve the accuracy of a model, you're going to need to be able to look at its activations and loss, and understand what's going on, and why. You can't do that properly if you don't understand your loss function.\n",

Try creating some small tensors yourself and pass them into the functions, to see what they return.\n",

        "Remember: the choices made in the implementation of cross-entropy loss are not the only possible choices that could have been made. Just like when we looked at regression we could choose between mean squared error and mean absolute difference (L1). If you have other ideas for possible functions that you think might work, feel free to give them a try in this chapter's notebook! (Fair warning though: you'll probably find that the model will be slower to train, and less accurate. That's because the gradient of cross-entropy loss is proportional to the difference between the activation and the target, so SGD always gets a nicely scaled step for the weights.)"
